            <h3>Welcome to Ariyamagga Senasuna</h3>
            <p >Situated about 3KM from the Kurunegala clock tower/city centre, The place was set up in 2007 to provide temporary accommodation to those forest monks from various parts of the Kurunegala district seeking treatment at the medical facilities in Kurunegala.</p>
            <p>It is mostly used by the meditating monks of Na Uyana aranya where over 150 Ven Bhikkhus,both local and foreign, are residing</p>
            <p>The idea was a  brainchild of most Venerable late Na-Uyane Ariyadamma Maha Thero.Mr.Bandara Prematilake (Bandara Mahattaya)  got the wind of it and decided to offer their family ancestral home to the Buddha Sasan a for this noble purpose. The incumbent monk Ven. Kamburugamuwe Wimalaratane was entrusted with the task of serving the Maha Sangha by running the place. </p>
            <p>The atmosphere is a blend of a traditional village temple and an Aranya and its air is conducive to village folks seeking to fulfill their worldly needs whilst  providing necessary counseling to strengthen the much needed skills(Parami )to traverse the path. Aged and sick monks receive lifelong care by volunteering village folks. There are four dedicated rooms (kutis)with two attached toilets for the sick and infirm. They provide the necessary seclusion for meditating Bhikkhus.</p>
